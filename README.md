# Split .csv Files With Python
How to split csv files based on a column's values using Python code

Consider you have an Excel file and you need to split it based on a column's values and you don't want to keep doing it manually. You can use VBA code, of course, but the process will take longer specially you have a file with dozens of thousands of rows.

Here I share a Python code that you can adapt to your needs. In my case, I saved the excel file as a .csv file. The reason whas to read it more easily, no matter the IDE you choose, with no additional packages (pandas will suffice).

That's it!
